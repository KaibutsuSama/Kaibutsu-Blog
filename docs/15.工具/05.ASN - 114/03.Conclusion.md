## Conclusion

### Racist

During the period of Chinese exclusion, the Chinese community suffered, such as 

1. `Violence` that resulted in the breaking up of a family, 
2. People `trashing` of Chinese stores, 
3. A white man was non-conviction for the `murder` of a Chinese man, 
4. The Page Act's `restriction` of Chinese women's entry into the U.S. making family reunification impossible; 

> These results were devastating to any community.

### In the present

Summing up the history and looking at the present, Racist is still happening around us, but its form has changed.
