## Chinese Exclusion Act

The Chinese Exclusion Act was signed on `May 6, 1882`, prohibiting all immigration of Chinese laborers for 10 years.The law is not inclund merchants, teachers, students, travelers, and diplomats.

> After the Page Act of 1875, the Chinese Exclusion Act is the only law ever to bar all members of a particular racial or ethnic group from immigrating to the United States.

Since then, measures to restrict immigration of other nationalities began to appear, and the United States has since changed from a country that welcomes almost all immigrants to a country that sets immigration thresholds
